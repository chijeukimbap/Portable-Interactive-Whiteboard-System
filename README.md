# Portable-Interactive-Whiteboard-System

The Portable Interactive Whiteboard System (PIWS) turns any
projection screen into an interactive whiteboard, enabling presenters to
annotate their presentations and interact with their computers directly
on the presentation screen. It is a camera-based interactive whiteboard
system that utilizes image processing algorithms to detect screen
interaction as opposed to using special conductive surfaces or
laminated wire arrays which are commonly found in resistive, capacitive
and electromagnetic boards.
